<summary>A Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun (Click to view details)</summary>
<p>Displayed above is the PPSh. Used during World War 2 by the Red Army, this submachine gun had a simple and cheap design that made it easy to mass-produce. 
While the Soviets had previously eschewed the usage of submachine guns in the Red Army, the Finns’ effective usage of submachine guns against the Red Army during the Winter War of 1939-1940 
brought about a reversal of this policy. Developed in 1940 and entering production the following year, the PPSh was still entering service during the initial German invasion. 
At the war’s end, 6 million PPSh had been manufactured and its usage was widespread across the entire Red Army. The PPSh continued being used by armies after the end of World War 2 and is still used today.</p>

<summary>A German Stahlhelm</summary>
<p>This helmet is a Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet), a German combat helmet issued to troops during World War 2. It is most likely of the M42 variant (but possibly also of the M35 or M40 variants), 
one of the most commonly issued helmets on the Eastern Front. Being developed in 1942, later in the war when Germany's resources were more scarce, 
the M42 was a stripped-down version of the earlier M35 version made with cheaper materials; additions to its steel alloys were of lower quality to 
allocate more resources for tank production, resulting in a softer steel less able to protect its wearer. This decrease in quality from previous models of 
Stahlhelm reflects the worsening situation of Germany at the time, with a growing inability to ration its strategic resources as liberally as it did during the early years of the war.</p> 
<p>The double lighting-bolt insignia on the side of the helmet indicate its owner was a member of the SS, or Schutzstaffel. The Schutzstaffel was an elite force which directly reported to the 
Nazi Party rather than the German military's high command. Its personnel overwhelmingly held fanatical support for Hitler and the Nazi Party, which was reinforced during their training. The 
Schutzstaffel was itself split up into two groups, Allgemeine-SS and Waffen-SS, which were responsible for policing and combat duties respectively; the owner of this helmet was most likely a member of 
the latter. Both wings of the organization were responsible for some of the worst Nazi atrocities of the war, including defending death camps and rounding up “undesirables” during the Holocaust. </p>

<summary>A destroyed IS-2 heavy tank</summary>
<p>The tank pictured here is the IS-2, a Soviet heavy tank produced during World War 2. The tank was designed as a counter to the German Panther and Tiger tanks, which themselves had been specifically designed
 to counter the T-34, the main tank in use with the Red Army at the time. With armor able to withstand direct hits from the feared German 88mm Flak cannon as well as a 122mm cannon capable of penetrating the
 Tiger’s armor, the IS-2 would prove to be a powerful opponent for German tanks. Deployed in combat starting in 1944, the IS-2 gained a reputation as a Tiger killer, with one regiment claiming to
 have killed 41 Tigers and Ferdinands (a heavy tank destroyer using the hull of a Tiger) over the space of 2 months, for the loss of only 8 tanks. Overall, over 3,000 IS-2s would be produced during World War 2.</p>
<p>This particular IS-2 appears to have been abandoned rather than destroyed, owing to the lack of any combat damage; most damage on the tank appears to be from aging, scavenging or deliberate stripping of components. </p>

<summary>A MP40 submachine gun</summary>
<p>The gun in this photo is the MP40, a German submachine gun that filled a similar niche to the PPSh. Its compact design owes to its origins, having been designed for use by mechanized infantry and paratroopers.
 Like its Soviet counterpart, the MP40 was cheap to produce and easy to maintain. While not produced in the same numbers as the PPSh (1.1 million units as compared to 6 million PPSh) it was still a highly prolific
 weapon; many MP40s remain in usage today with irregular troops in Syria and Libya.</p>

<summary>A Soviet Mosin-Nagant sniper rifle</summary>
<p>The rifle pictured here is a Mosin-Nagant Model 1891. This model of rifle was used as the primary sniper rifle of the Red Army during World War 2.
 First being adopted by the Imperial Russian army in 1893, the rifle had previously seen service as the primary infantry rifle of the Russians during World War 1.
 In the interwar years, the rifle was modified to hold a scope and adopted the role of a sniper rifle. Thanks to its reliability and accuracy, the Mosin-Nagant excelled in
 this role and played an important role in World War 2, especially on the Finnish-Soviet front where it was used by both Finnish and Soviet snipers, including the infamous Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä. 
 The rifle continued being used as the primary sniper rifle of the Soviet forces until 1963 and has continued being used up to the present day.</p>
