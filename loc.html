<summary>Pavlov's House and it's war memorial (Click to show details)</summary>
<p>During the Battle of Stalingrad, Pavlov’s House was the site of one of the most famous last stands of World War 2. </p>
<p>On September 27th, 1942, while German forces were still advancing into Stalingrad, a Soviet platoon led by junior sergeant Yakov Pavlov retook an apartment building in the center of Stalingrad. Despite the loss of all
 but 4 men in his platoon, the apartment building was reinforced with additional troops and fortified by the Soviets, with orders to hold the building against the Germans as long as possible. Due to it holding a strategic
 position within its region of Stalingrad, the Germans mounted their own attempts to retake the apartment building, with infantry and tanks assaulting the house several times per day; furthermore, Pavlov’s house was bombed
 by the Luftwaffe on at least one occasion during the battle. Despite their persistence, the Germans would always be driven back by the defenders, who used the building’s strong fortifications to their advantage. After 58
 days of siege by the Germans, the building would be relieved by Soviet reinforcements, with the Germans having sustained an unknown number of heavy casualties. In exchange, the defenders of Pavlov’s house only suffered
 3 casualties.</p>
<p>After the war, Pavlov’s house was repaired and reinstated as a residential building concurrent with the wider restoration of Stalingrad. The building still stands in the present day and hosts a war memorial dedicated
 to the defenders of the house during the Battle of Stalingrad.</p>

<summary>The Reichstag, Berlin</summary>
<p>Pictured above in its current state, the Reichstag is a famous building in Berlin that played an important role during the interwar years and World War 2. After its construction in 1891, the building served as
 the parliament of the German Empire and the Weimar Republic respectively from 1894 until its destruction in the Reichstag Fire of 1933. The latter event was used as justification by then-chancellor Adolf Hitler to
 pass emergency measures effectively turning Germany into a dictatorship. The new Nazi regime relocated government functions from the Reichstag, which was left abandoned in the center of Berlin. Nevertheless, the Reichstag
 remained a prominent landmark in Berlin leading to its targeting during Allied bombing raids and the Soviet capture of Berlin. In the latter event, the Reichstag became the site of the famous photograph,
 “Raising a Flag Over the Reichstag”. The building remained derelict for the duration of Cold War, with the capital remaining in the West German city of Bonn even after German reunification in 1990. In 1994,
 restoration work was started on the Reichstag which concluded in 1999. Today, the Reichstag is the home of the German Bundestag (the lower house of the German parliament) as well as a popular tourist attraction
 in Berlin, often being named among the ranks of other famous landmarks such as the Brandenburg Gate and the Tiergarten.</p>
