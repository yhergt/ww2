<summary>A destroyed BT-7, during the early days of Operation Barbarossa (1941) (Click to show details)</summary>
<p>From 1935 to 1941, the BT-7 served as the main battle tank of the Red Army. The tank followed the British doctrine of “cruiser” or “cavalry” tanks, sacrificing armor and armament in exchange for high mobility.
 The BT-7 was used during conflicts of the late interwar period as well as the early war; namely the battles of Lake Hasan and Kalkhin Gol, and the Soviet invasion of Poland. During Operation Barbarossa, over 2000 BT-7s
 were lost in combat or broke down, with the BT-7 in the image appearing to have been one of the former. The BT-7 continued to be used until the end of the war in 1945 but was mostly supplanted by the T-34, which performed
 much better against German armor.</p>

<summary>Ukrainian women greet German troops during the invasion of Ukraine (1941)</summary>
<p>During the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the subsequent occupation of its territories, a large number of people from the western territories of the Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine and the Baltic countries,
 celebrated the German invasion and even collaborated with the occupying forces. These nations had possessed distinct national identities before their incorporation into the Soviet Union and many thought that occupation under
 the Germans was preferable to Soviet rule, since the former might allow for a restoration of their national identity while the latter had instituted repressive policies of collectivization and political persecution.
 Nevertheless, the Germans still exacted a heavy toll on occupied territory; for example, in Ukraine, 1.5 million Jewish Ukrainians were killed in the Holocaust and a further 2.2 million Ukrainians were deported to Germany
 to be used as slave labor.</p>

<summary>"Arrest in the Warsaw Ghetto" (1943)</summary>
<p>The photograph above, “Arrest in the Warsaw Ghetto”, also known as “Warsaw Ghetto Boy”, is one of the most famous photographs of the Holocaust; it depicts a group of Jewish women and children being deported by
 German troops, the subject of the photograph being a young boy being held at the point of a submachine gun. This photograph was taken during the German “liquidation” of the Warsaw Ghetto, wherein the Jewish population
 of the ghetto was deported to death camps following the unsuccessful Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April-May 1943. The photographer is unknown but was likely a member of, or collaborator with the SS, as this image was
 originally discovered attached on correspondence directly addressed to Heinrich Himmler. </p>

<summary>"Raising a Flag Over the Reichstag" (1945)</summary>
<p>Above is perhaps one of, if not the most famous photographs of World War 2 – “Raising a Flag Over the Reichstag”. This photograph was taken on May 2, 1945 during the closing days of the Battle of Berlin.
 In the preceding days, Soviet troops had fought their way into the heart of Berlin and taken the Reichstag, defended by a garrison of 2,000 German troops, on the 30th of April. In the days between the taking
 of the Reichstag and the creation of the photograph, the Soviet flag had allegedly been raised atop the Reichstag several times; however, “Raising a Flag Over the Reichstag” would be the first photograph of
 a Soviet flag on the Reichstag. The photograph therefore did not capture the initial moment of the flag-raising; furthermore, it was doctored before publication to add further dramatized elements (such as smoke
 in the background) as well as to remove evidence potentially implicating the flag-raiser, a Lieutenant Qoshqarbaev, of looting, a penalty potentially punishable by execution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, “Raising a Flag Over the Reichstag” still served as a powerful symbol of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany and, in the present day, remains one of the most famous photographs ever taken.</p>
